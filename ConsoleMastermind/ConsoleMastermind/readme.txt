1. go to the following url link to download the code

2. Load the code into Visual Studio. The code include three files,
- Program.cs - a driver to run a console application
- MastermindGame.cs -  include a main logic for mastermind game
- GameRecord.cs - a pojo or domain class to hold each guessing record
- also have project(ConsoleMastermind.csproj) and solution(ConsoleMastermind.sln) files for Visual Studio since the code is intended to run inside VS.


3. Programming Exercise
Create a C# console application that is a simple version of Mastermind.  The randomly generated answer should be four (4) digits in length, with each digit between the numbers 1 and 6.  After the player enters a combination, a minus (-) sign should be printed for every digit that is correct but in the wrong position, and a plus (+) sign should be printed for every digit that is both correct and in the correct position.  Nothing should be printed for incorrect digits.  The player has ten (10) attempts to guess the number correctly before receiving a message that they have lost.
